EuroPython Theme for moin
=========================

This theme is used as basis for the https://wiki.python.org/ moin wiki
website.

It was written by Radomir Dopieralski in 2009 based on the default moin
theme, in order to adapt the looks to Python.org website of the time.

This is a fork of the original version.

In case you wonder: This theme was used for the EuroPython conferences 2009
and 2010: https://www.europython-society.org/europython/#europython-2009
